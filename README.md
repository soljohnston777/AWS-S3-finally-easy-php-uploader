composer --version

With Command prompt or Powershell Admin -
in windows in your folder C:\xampp\htdocs\AWS-S3-finally-easy-php-uploader\ run:

composer require aws/aws-sdk-php

&nbsp;
<h3>Then <strong>create your s3</strong> <strong>bucket</strong> on:</h3>

<strong>Create a new key RIGHT NOW</strong>.... it will save your butt!
(I had so many problems by "Not" doing this, and you can still keep your old keys anyways)

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Then use the code in this repository.</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The code has notes to make it easy!</h2>

I will have a course on https://www.secretlesson.com about how to use S3 and how to secure it.
